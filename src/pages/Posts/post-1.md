# Post #1

Published on: Februrary 5, 2024

Since beginning this tutorial, around January 10th, ive progressed through the first couple of steps. 
I've had a few things getting in the way, like full time work, and then this road trip that i'm currently on.

HOWEVER!

I have resigned from my full time job so i can focus on learning to code, and I'm currently on a very relaxing farm, with some downtime to keep learning.


The style of this page - white background, black words, default font - is how the whole website looked at the beginning.
No variation except for the 'heading' and 'body' presets.

Here's a little rundown on my "stack" (the tools i'm using)

**.MD file**

The page you're currently reading is a .md file stored on my computer.
A .md file (meaning 'markdown documentation') is a kind of file used to store basic text.

**GitHub**

The file is stored within a directory called 'blog' (a specific folder on my computer) which i have linked to GitHub. 
Git Hub is an online 'Version Control' service. It tracks every change made in any file within my 'blog' directory. 
GitHub has 'repositories' which represent the project in it's most public, most published form. 

**VS Code**

I'm using VS Code to edit my code. It's possible to edit code without a code editor - i'm pretty sure if you're using HTML you can just create a .html file and edit it, then view it from a browser. 
A code editor like VS code helps you detect bugs, adds color-coding and predictive text.
The most important use for a code editor is it's ability to link with a version control provider like GitHub.
Any time i make a change to the code, i have to press a button and "commit" the change, with a little message on what i did.

**NEtlify**

Finally, Netlify is what actually hosts the GitHub repository on the World Wide Web.
I think in Netlify you can purchase domain names, so the website appears like normal - instead of having the .netlify.app extention.

**Astro**

Astro is a language which - as i understand it - combines elements of javascript and HTML. 
It provides the most flexibility and ease-of-use for a blog-style website.
I'm also following their tutorial called 'Build a Blog', which is centered around the Astro language.
I like the language so far, and the tutorial is really good.

Overall, i'm enjoring the process. Learning how to take a file on my computer and see it hosted on the internet, and being able to share it with friends, was really something special.
The more i learn the more ideas i have for websites and UI designs, and i'm determined to advance my skillset to the point where i can flesh out these visions.
