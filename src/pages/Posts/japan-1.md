With a melancholy heart and an unnaturally clenched jaw, I said goodbye to my friends and boarded the 4am Skybus to the airport. I then realised the plan I had devised involved no sleeping. Bit of an oversight. I resolved to sleep as much as I could on the flights.

The first flight was to Cairns and I honestly can’t remember any of that flight. Did some work during the layover, then boarded my flight to Kansai. Me and the flight attendant developed a rapport, and he kept offering me free stuff. I didn’t know why I was getting special treatment, but with a coffee and a cup of noodles in each hand, and Dune 2 playing on the TV, I wasn’t questioning it. Perhaps that Club Jetstar membership I bought is more valuable than I first thought.

Okay so… these Kanji are a bit hard to read aren’t they. Nothing a little Google translate can’t fix. Made my way to the air bnb, did some more work, watched Avatar and slept like a baby.

June 18. Woke up real stiff. Been having back pain recently. Decided to stretch and work out every day and return to Melbourne very buff. Went out for some lunch to overcome my fear of ordering food. Duolingo has taught me mizu (water) o Cha (green tea) go han (rice) and ku da sai (please). So I can order rice with water and tea, please. As long as they don’t ask any follow ups I’ll be g!

It was a bit tricky and embarrassing to not understand anything they asked me, but they were kind and patient with me which I appreciated. Delicious food. It was pork over eggs, with a platter of sides. I Came back home and had a deep nap.

At 4:30pm I was ready to head into town. I wasn’t stoked with my fit, but embarked nonetheless, with my eyes set towards Dotonburi….

In the hours before my 4am Skybus, Lewis and I had our closing night of Freddie - a performance which shares Lewis’ struggle to identify, present, and be perceived within a broader queer community, while maintaining the essence of themself, and their desire to be vulnerable and open with those around them. The show is somewhere between theatre and performance art, and uses the loose context of picking an outfit for a night out as a base for wider themes. We watch Lewis cycle through endless choices, and turn each of them down. I think I must have shown up to every rehearsal in the same clothes. My “uniform” comprising of one of three pants I like, one of five shirts I like, and one of 2 jumpers I like. I’ve never not cared about fashion, but rarely spent more than 1 minute choosing a fit.

Many positives have come from collaborating with Lewis. I was able to see a project through from beginning to end for the first time in years. I rediscovered a love of theatre and performance art. I got to meet Lewis’ interesting and kind friends. Out of all of these, a newfound respect and consideration for fashion was the most unexpected.

So here I am in Dotonburi wearing… blue shorts and a Hawaiian shirt with my knees very very EXPOSED. This does not feel good!

I guess it's a good thing I have cared little about clothes up until now, because I have a feeling every item currently residing in my backpack will remain in Japan forever, and I’ll return with fits upon fits, each one a little bit more… Mike.
